My standard guitar is a 1963 Guild Stuart 500 (AS-500).  I picked it up back around 
1995, when I cashed out my retirement account as I left Intel.  According to the 
salesman it was once guitar of <a href="http://www.jerryhahn.com/">Jerry Hahn</a>, 
which was later confirmed by a former student of his who recognized it.  When I 
recieved it, it was missing the original pickup, which had been replaced with with 
an EMG active pickup.  I found that that had a little bit too pure of a sound for me 
so I replaced it with a 
<a href="http://benedettopickups.com/products.htm">Benedetto S-6</a>.  One of the 
nice things about the pickup is that I can use it with bronze strings so I get a 
really nice acoustic sound and electrically the sound has a nice "speaking" quality.
</p>
<p>
For my amp, I go with the jazz standard, the 
<a href="http://polytoneamps.com">Polytone</a>.  Yes, you can get better jazz 
guitar amps.  But for the price and durability, you can't get a better sounding amp.  
Maybe someday, if I have the money, I'll upgrade to something else, but for now I'll 
just have to stay with the fine workhorse of an amp.
</p>
<p>
I've tried many different strings over the years.  Of course, as I said, I use bronze 
strings because of how the pickup is voiced.  I finally settled on the 
<a href="http://www.daddario.com/">D'Addario</a> 
<a href="http://store.daddario.com/category/144850/EJ17_Medium_13-56">EJ17s</a>, 
medium phosphor bronze acoustic strings, 13-56.  I had experimented with 14s for a 
while but I found that they gave a great tone, the higher tension was a bit much 
when playing chord-melody (because of the need to hold down the strings for so long 
in such big chords.)  Plus, I like that I can get the 13s in 10-packs &mdash; more 
econimical and better for the eviroment.
</p>
<p>
For cables I finally settled on <a href="http://georgelsstore.com/">George L's</a>.  
They have the high conductance of a high quality string without the high price.  
I've also seen tests where they have a higher durability than other more expensive 
cables.  Perhaps the greatest feature of these is that the plugs can be easily 
removed, the end of the cable can be recut and the plug can be replaced.  This makes 
it <i>very</i> easy to fix breaks in the cable.  I actually just bought a 50' roll 
of the .155 cable and a bunch of plugs and built my own cables.
</p>
<p>
For a pick, I go with the 
<a href="http://www.jimdunlop.com/index.php?page=products/pip&id=3&pmh=products/picks">Jim Dunlop Jazz II black picks</a>. 
I like that they are smaller than the standard pick size, common to many jazz players.  
I think that we like the control of being closer to the strings.
</p>
<p>
I guess that I could also mention that I have an old 1961 Gibson TB-100 tenor 
banjo that I pull out for the occasional Dixie gig.
</p>

<h2>My Classical Rig</h2>
<p>
My classical set up is obviously much simpler.  The guitar I have now is a 
<a href="http://www.cordobaguitars.com">C&oacute;rdoba</a> 50R, a low level 
cedar top guitar.  In the future I hope to upgrade to something better and 
possibly drip a piezo pickup into this one.
</p>

<p>
Being a taller guy, especially in the upper body, I had a big problem getting 
guitar into a good position.  I found that I was contorting my upper body.  Even 
with the footstool all the way up I was still straining and now my leg was in a 
bad position.  I finally decided to try leg supports.  After trying many fine 
supports, I settled on the murata guitar support.  I find that this gets the 
guitar into a good position and with a footstool on its lowest setting, I can 
sit with good posture for hours.  Because of the increased angle of the guitar 
on my right leg I usually put a piece of black shelf liner (a rubber mesh) on 
my right thigh.
</p>
<p>
As to strings, I am currently in flux.  I was using the 
<a href="http://www.savarez.fr/anglais/carterougejb.html">Savarez 520R</a> strings.  
I liked the distinct sound and feel of the rectified nylon trebles.  But I found 
that I wasn't getting enough oomph in the high notes &mdash due more to the low 
quality of this particular guitar model than to the strings.  Lately I've been 
experiemnting with 
<a href="http://store.daddario.com/category/146079/T2_Titanium_Trebles_Singles">D'Addario T2 Titanium Strings</a> 
and I think that there is more pressence in the upper notes.
</p>
<p>
Of course nails are a big part of classical guitar playing.  In addition to a 
standard nail file, I like to use 
<a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Manufacturing/Industry/Product-Catalog/Online-Catalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GE3E02LECFTDQGLE0_nid=GSRHC6S1HHgs060CVBK1Q8glKRV0KD7CKMbl">3M 405N Tri-M-ite "fre-cut", 500A</a> 
for everyday sanding.  Rather than keep buying it sheet by sheet at the local guitar 
store, I just went ahead and got online and got a whole box of 100 sheets.  I like 
to cut them up into a bunch of 2" squares and even keep one in my wallet in case of 
emergencies.
</p>

<h2>My Rock Rig</h2>
<p>
I'll have to admit that I don't do many rock gigs much anymore.  My rig is essentially 
left over from my cruise ship days, but I sometimes drag it out for theater gigs.  
My rock guitar is a <a href="http://www.cortguitars.com">Cort</a> MGM-1, the Matt 
"Guitar" Murphy signature model.  The funny thing was that I was living in New Orleans and 
had just sold off my old Jeff Beck strat when I got a call to do <i>Little Shop of 
Horrors</i>, for which I would need a solid body guitar.  Aye!  So I made a deal with 
the shop owner where I teached for the MGM, which I had been admiring.  I loved it!  
There were more expensive guitars there, but there was just something about this one that 
spoke to me.
</p>
<p>
For signal processing, I have an old <a href="http://www.rolandus.com/">Boss</a> GT-6 that 
does the trick well, also a hold over from my cruise ship days.  Other than that, most 
of the ricg is the same as my jazz set-up.  I use D'Addario 
<a href="http://store.daddario.com/category/145800/EXL115_BluesJazz_Rock_11-49">EXL115</a> 
(nickel wound, 11-46, plain 3rd).  I used the same JD Jazz II pick, but here I use the red 
version &mdash; slightly thinner and more flexible.
