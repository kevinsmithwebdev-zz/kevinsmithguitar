<br/><br/>

<p>This is meant to be a glossary of terms used for jazz guitar.  Some terms will be specific to jazz guitar while many 
will be more general to jazz or music.  Some are merely technical.  These definitions are mine and reflect my beliefs and 
experience, though I have tried to include other interpretations where appropriate.  If you have any suggestions or 
corrections, please email me at ksjazzguitar@yahoo.com.  I may not choose to incorporate your suggestion, but I will 
listen to it.</p>

<br/><br/>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("AABA"); ?>
One of the most common of all <?php DefLink("Form","forms"); ?> in jazz music.  It is an A section, then a contrasting B 
section, followed by a final A section.  Typically each section is 8 bars long making for a total of 32 bars.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Aebersold"); ?>
Jamey Aebersold is a noted jazz educator.  One of the things for which he is most famous is producing 
<?php DefLink("play-along"); ?> recordings.  
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Antecedent"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("call and response"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("A-Train Ending"); ?>
This is possibly the most common <?php DefLink("ending"); ?> there is, and is also known as the "Ellington Ending."  
As you approach the end of a song, someone may holler out, "Ellington" or the bass player may just play it expecting 
everyone to follow him.  It is taken from the Ellington song <i>Take the A-Train</i>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Ax"); ?>
Musician slang for an instrument.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Backdoor Turnaround"); ?>
Instead of the usual turnaround of a ii7-V7, a iv7-bVII7 is played from the key a minor 3rd up.  For example, in the 
key of C, instead of Dm7 &#8211; G7 &#8211; C, Fm7 &#8211; Bb7 &#8211; C is played.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Basie Ending"); ?>
Here is a common <?php DefLink("ending"); ?> popularized by Count Basie.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Bebop Blues"); ?>
These are a slightly jazzed up version of the <?php DefLink("twleve-bar blues"); ?>, very common in the jazz repertoire.  
There are a lot of <?php DefLink("substitution","substitutions"); ?>, but not as much as Bird blues.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Bird Blues"); ?>
These are named after Charlie &#8220;Bird&#8221; Parker.  They are a highly <?php DefLink("reharmonization","reharmonized"); ?> 
<?php DefLink("twelve-bar blues"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Blow"); ?>
To <?php DefLink("improvise"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Blue Note"); ?>
A blue note is a slightly dissonant note characteristic of the <?php DefLink("blues"); ?>.  The blue notes are usually 
the minor third, the tri-tone and sometimes the minor 7th.  On a C chord, these would be Eb, Gb, and Bb.  It is the 
juxtaposition of these notes over the top of a chord where these notes don&#8217;t normally belong that creates the sound 
of the blues.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Blues"); ?>
Blues is a style of music.
Within the world of jazz, Blues is a category of music that has some of the same characteristics of the style of Blues.  
Almost all of them have a chord progression based on the <?php DefLink("twelve-bar blues"); ?>.
</p>
<p>
<?php DefTitle("Break"); ?>
A break is where the <?php DefLink("rhythm section"); ?> stops playing for a few bars and the melody or solo is 
unaccompanied.  It is very common to have a two bar break at the end of the <?php DefLink("head"); ?> (where you might normally 
have a <?php DefLink("turnaround"); ?>) to allow the soloist to start his solo two bars early.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Breakdown"); ?>
To simplify the accompaniment, especially with more funk oriented feels.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Bridge"); ?>
In jazz, this term is used differently than how pop and rock musicians use it.  To jazzers, the bridge is the contrasting part 
of the song.  For example, if the form is <?php DefLink("AABA"); ?>, then the B section is the bridge.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Burn"); ?>
&#8220;To burn&#8221; is to play fast.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Call and Response"); ?>
This is the concept of playing a melodic statement that seems incomplete, and then playing a phrase that seems to complete it.  
This is also called question and answer and antecedent and consequent.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Chops"); ?>
Originally, chops referred to the lips of a brass player.  Now it refers to the technical and musical abilities of a musician.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Chorus"); ?>
This term is used differently in different types of music.  For a pop musician, it refers to a part of the song that is 
repeated at various points.  But to a jazz musician, a chorus is once through the entire form of a song.  For example, a 
common practice is play the melody for one chorus, improvise for one (or multiple choruses) and the play one last chorus of 
the melody at the end.  The term chorus is also sometimes used in old <?php DefLink("standard","standards"); ?> (especially 
those from Broadway) that have an introduction called a <?php DefLink("verse"); ?>.  Chorus is also an effect sometimes 
used on guitar to produce a thicker sound.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Charlie, Christian"); ?>
One of the pioneers of jazz guitar.  He did ground breaking work with Benny Goodman, being one of the first guitar 
players to take solos in a big band and to play along with the horns.  He was also one of the founders of the Bebop 
movement before we died of TB.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Clam"); ?>
A clam is note that is played badly or a wrong note.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Comp"); ?>
"Comp" is either short for "accompany" or "complement."  In either case, "comping" is to play behind and support a melody or a soloist.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Compresion"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("quote"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Consequent"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("call and response"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Count Basie"); ?>
A famous big band leader, very famous for his hard swinging charts.  A big part of his sound was the hard driving rhythm 
guitar of <?php DefLink("Green, Freddie","Freddie Green"); ?>.  
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Dragging"); ?>
This is playing slightly slower than the rest of the band so that things tend to slow down.  It is part of "<?php DefLink("time feel"); ?>".
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Ellington Ending"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("A-Train Ending"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Ending"); ?>
This is the piece of music at the end of the song.  Some songs have specific outros.  There are also certain common outros 
that can be spontaneously added to songs; <?php DefLink("A-Train Ending"); ?>, <?php DefLink("Basie Ending"); ?>, 
<?php DefLink("iii-vi-ii-V"); ?> <?php DefLink("tag"); ?>, etc.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Fake"); ?>
"To fake" a song is to play it even though there is no arrangement.  This is common practice in a jazz combo.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Fake Book"); ?>
When musicians used to <?php DefLink("fake"); ?> tunes, they sometimes wrote out these tunes as part of learning the tunes.  
Sometimes they were collected in books,  Now fake books are available commercially.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Fast Four"); ?>
The use of a IV chord in the second bar of a <?php DefLink("twelve-bar blues"); ?>.
</p>


<p>
<?php DefTitle("Form"); ?>
The arrangement of different sections of a song.  These sections are often labeled with letters.  For example, the song 
<i>Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star</i> would have an ABA form. There is a melodic statement at the beginning (A), followed 
by a contrasting melody (B) and then the original melody is stated again.  Sometimes, successive sections (As, Bs, etc.) 
may differ slightly melodically or harmonically (especially in that last few bars), but that is not important.  In jazz, 
the different sections are often 8 bars long.  The form <?php DefLink("AABA"); ?> is the most common form in jazz, and 
indeed in much popular music.  Some songs have forms that cannot be easily be broken into neat sections.  There is some 
subjectivity in how long a section is and whether a particular section differs enough to be called unique enough to receive 
its own letter designation.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Four to the Bar"); ?>
This is playing four chords to the measure, one quarter note for each.  This is characteristic of the Swing Era, 
especially of Big Band music.  This is often used synonymously with playing a <?php DefLink("Green, Freddie","Freddie Green"); ?> style.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Green, Freddie"); ?>
Legendary rhythm guitar player for the <?php DefLink("Count Basie"); ?> band.  While many different big band 
<?php DefLink("rhythm guitar"); ?> styles exist, his is probably considered the quintessential.  There are many contrasting theories 
about how to produce his sound.  One of the best explanations I have found is at <a href="http://www.freddiegreen.org">www.freddiegreen.org</a>.  

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Head"); ?>
The melody of the tune.  Towards the end of a song, someone may yell out "head" or simply point to their head to indicate to play 
the melody and finish the tune.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("I-vi-ii-V"); ?>
It is a common chord progression, often used in <?php DefLink("tag","tags"); ?>, <?php DefLink("turnaround","turnarounds"); ?> 
or <?php DefLink("vamp","vamps"); ?>.  In the key of C, a I-vi-ii-V would be CM7 &#8211; Am7 &#8211; Dm7 &#8211; G7.  
In practice, some of the minor chords will be made dominant.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("ii-V-I"); ?>
This is one of the most common chord progressions in jazz and is the building block of many songs.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("iii-vi-ii-V"); ?>
It is a common chord progression, often used in <?php DefLink("tag","tags"); ?>, <?php DefLink("turnaround","turnarounds"); ?> 
or <?php DefLink("vamp","vamps"); ?>.  In the key of C, a iii-vi-ii-V would be Em7 &#8211; Am7 &#8211; Dm7 &#8211; G7.  
In practice, some of the minor chords will be made dominant.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Improvise"); ?>
To take a <?php DefLink("solo"); ?> and to spontaneously create a melody.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Intro"); ?>
A short piece of music put at the front of the song.  Some songs have specific intros.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Jack in the Box"); ?>
A common rhythm used to set up a hit on the "and" of "2".  The rhythm is "1 and 2 and."
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Latin"); ?>
Jazz music with South American origins, or with a rhythm that originates there. In modern jazz it means 
Brazilian bossa novas and sambas but may also includes many dance rhythms like rhumbas, cha-chas, beguines, mambos, 
etc.  It often includes non-latin rhythms like calypso and is often broadly taken to mean any jazz that doesn&#8217;t swing.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Laying Back"); ?>
A type of <?php DefLink("time feel"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Lay Out"); ?>
Sometimes, someone will ask you to "lay out" for a <?php DefLink("chorus"); ?>, or just stop playing.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Lead Sheet"); ?>
A lead sheet is a simple melody and a chord progression written out on a sheet of paper.  It's often 
used as a <?php DefLink("fake"); ?> chart.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Loose the Form"); ?>
This is forgetting where you are in the <?php DefLink("form"); ?>, and to be playing a different part of the song than everyone else.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Monitor"); ?>
When performing live or in a studio, you sometimes need a small speaker, a monitor, in front of you so 
that you can hear yourself and the other musicians.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Music-Minus-One"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("play-along"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Nesitco, Sammy"); ?>
The arranger for <?php DefLink("Count Basie"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Outro"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("ending"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Pick"); ?>
A small piece of plastic, wood, metal, tortoise shell, etc. used to strike the strings.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Play-Along"); ?>
A recording without a melody or solo.  It allows you to practice <?php DefLink("improvise","improvising"); ?> over the chord changes. 
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Plectrum"); ?>
It is another word for a <?php DefLink("pick"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Pushing"); ?>
This is playing slightly faster than the rest of the band so that things tend to speed up.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Question and Answer"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("call and response"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Quote"); ?>
Using a small, recognizable fragment of another melody in an arrangement or solo.  It is sometimes called a compression, 
especially by singers.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Real Book"); ?>
In the seventies, a group of students and teachers at Berklee put together a bunch of their fake charts into a 
<?php DefLink("fake book","book"); ?>.  They called it the "Real Book" because these were the "real" (presumably 
more accurate) ways to play these tunes.  Although they remain popular, they are technically illegal (no royalties 
were paid) and are therefore difficult to find.  There are now several other legal fake books that are readily available.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Reharmonization"); ?>
The changing of the chords to make a chord progression more interesting.  This differs from <?php DefLink("substitution"); ?> 
in that the fundamental harmonic function is altered, sometimes radically.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Rhythm Guitar"); ?>
The art of <?php DefLink("comp","accompanying"); ?> others by providing chordal and rhythmic support.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Rhythm Section"); ?>
This is the part of the band that provides the <?php DefLink("comp","accompaniment"); ?>.  It typically contains a 
bass and drums and either a piano or guitar (or both.)  Vibes would also be considered part of the rhythm section.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Ride"); ?>
To "take a ride" is to take and <?php DefLink("improvise","improvised"); ?> <?php DefLink("solo"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Rushing"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("pushing"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Scat"); ?>
To <?php DefLink("improvise"); ?> vocally, usually with non-sense syllables.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Shout"); ?>
A shout section is a portion of a song where everyone plays a melody together, often the high point of the arrangement.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Soli"); ?>
A non-improvised solo played by more than one instrument.  It is very common in big band music.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Solo"); ?>
This is and instrument playing a melody by itself (but usually with <?php DefLink("comp","accompaniment"); ?>.)  
In jazz, "solo" usualy refers to an improvised solo.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Standard"); ?>
The concept of a "standard" has changed over time.  Originally it meant a popular song (from the jazz age or before) 
that was used as a jazz song.  For some, it also includes tunes composed by jazz musicians that have become part of the 
"standard" repertoire.
</p>


<p>
<?php DefTitle("Stop Time"); ?>
Sometimes the band will stop playing time and just hit the chords in a certain rhythmic patern, for example, 
on beat one of each measure.  A melody or solo is usually played over the top.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Straight"); ?>
Straight refers to the a 1:1 ratio of the eighth notes, as opposed to a <?php DefLink("swing"); ?> interpretation.  
<?php DefLink("Latin"); ?> jazz is a good example of a straight eighth notes.   
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Substitution"); ?>
The changing of some of the chords in a chord progression, usually to make it more interesting.  This can be done at 
arranging time or spontaneously.  Substitution differs from <?php DefLink("reharmonization"); ?> in that the basic 
harmonic function remains the same. 
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Swing"); ?>
If you want to start an argument, ask a group of musicians to define swing.  In a group of five musicians, there will 
be at least seven definitions of swing.  I will start with the simplest aspects of swing and get more advanced.
One of the major components of swing is that of the relationship of the eighth notes.  Traditionally, two successive 
eighth notes will have equal value, a 1:1 relationship.  In other words, each eight note will last for 50% of the duration 
of the whole quarter note.  This is called straight eight notes.  But in jazz, not all eighth notes are equal.
The simplest definition is that swing eight notes are long-short.  The first eighth note takes up 67% of the duration 
and the second gets 33%, or a 2:1 relationship.  Sometimes this is represented as eight note triplets with the first two tied together.
In reality, this 2:1 relationship is not a given.  It holds true at moderate tempos (about 120 bpm), but will tend to 
shorten (approach a 1:1 ratio) as the tempo increases and it will tend to lengthen (approach a 3:1) ratio at slower tempos.  
But the ratios will also differ from player to player.  Another characteristic of swing is that the second eighth note 
tends to be accented and slurred into the next eighth note.  It also often incorporates syncopation.  
True swing defies analytical definition.  Try to listen to great players and absorb their swing feel.
Swing can also refer to and era of jazz music.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Syncopation"); ?>
Simple melodies often put the melody on the beat.  For example, in 4/4 time, the melody would tend to 
land on the quarter notes.  But syncopation puts some of the melody on the eighth notes in between the beats.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Tag"); ?>
Repeating the last 2-8 measures of a song at the end.  It may stay in the original key or, from one of 
the tags, it may go up a M2 or even a m3.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Time Feel"); ?>
The placement of notes relative to the pulse of the song.  One might assume that notes are to be 
played right on the beat (on top of the beat).  But it reality, you can play the notes slightly 
behind the beat (laying back) or ahead of the beat.  This is not to be confused with dragging or 
pushing, where you are playing at a different tempo than the rest of the band.  In jazz, it is very common 
to play slightly behind the beat.  You are playing at the same tempo, there is just a slight time 
delay before each of your notes.  This creates a laid back, cool, relaxed feeling.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Top"); ?>
See <?php DefLink("head"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Tops and Tails"); ?>
This refers to the <?php DefLink("intro","beginning"); ?> and <?php DefLink("ending"); ?> of songs.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Trading"); ?>
Sometimes, during a <?php DefLink("solo"); ?>, soloists may take turns playing two, four, eight, 
or some other number of bars.  It is very common to "trade fours" with the drummer.  Please note that 
during each of the drummer&#8217;s four bar solo, even though no chords are being played, the chord 
progression is still transpiring.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Transcribe"); ?>
This is the art of listening to and then writing down music.  It is often applied to listening to a recorded 
<?php DefLink("solo"); ?> and writing it down.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Transpose"); ?>
Transposition is putting a song into another key.  Some instruments are called "transposing" instruments, 
because they naturally play in an offset key.  A trumpet for example, is called a "Bb" instrument, because 
when he sees a C, he plays a C, but on the piano, it is really a Bb.  This means that if you want him to 
play <i>Take the A-Train</i> in the key of C, then you need to tell him to play in the key of D.  
Alto saxophone is an "Eb" instrument so if you want to play <i>Summertime</i> in the key of Am, you need to 
give him a <?php DefLink("lead sheet"); ?> in the key of F#m.  Of the jazz instruments, clarinet, trumpet, 
soprano saxophone, and tenor saxophone are Bb instruments and alto saxophone and baritone saxophone are 
Eb instruments.  Technically, both guitar and bass are also transposing instruments in that they transpose 
down and octave; they play the note one octave down from the one written.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Turnaround"); ?>
A small piece of music (usually 2 bars) at the end of the <?php DefLink("chorus"); ?>, used to bring us back 
to the beginning.  It is not added onto the chorus but is built into the chord progression.  If there is no 
turnaround specified in the chord progression, musicians will typically add them automatically.  This works 
since most melodies end two bars before the end of the chorus.  Two of the most common turnarrounds are 
<?php DefLink("iii-vi-ii-V"); ?> and <?php DefLink("I-vi-ii-V"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Turn Around the Beat"); ?>
This means to accidentally loose or gain and beat so that you are now one beat out of phase with the rest 
of the band.  Now, instead of your accents being on beats two and four where they belong, they are now on one and three.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Twelve-Bar Blues"); ?>
This is a very common chord progression in jazz, rock, country, and (of course) in the <?php DefLink("blues"); ?>.  It can 
be in the style of blues, in a jazzy style, or anything in between.  It can be in a simple, old-style form, in the form 
of <?php DefLink("bebop blues"); ?>, or even <?php DefLink("Bird blues"); ?>.  As extravagant as the substitutions 
can get, all twelve-bar blues tend to have a four bar phrase centered around the I chord, another four bar phrase 
centered around the IV chord for the first few bars, and a final four bars that starts with the first two bars 
centering around the V chord and then the final two bars <?php DefLink("turnaround","turning around"); ?> to the top.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Vamp"); ?>
A small, simple (often just a one or two chords) musical section that is repeated until cued to continue.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Verse"); ?>
This term is used differently in different types of music.  For a pop musician, it refers to a part of the song that is 
repeated with different lyrics each time.  But to a jazz musician, the verse is an introduction to a <?php DefLink("standard"); ?> (especially 
those from Broadway.)
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Vocalese"); ?>
Singers would take scatting to a whole new level and write out a story and set it to the melody of some 
instrumentalist's <?php DefLink("improvise","improvised"); ?> <?php DefLink("solo"); ?>.  Sometimes, entire 
big band arrangements were sung with the help of multi tracking, the singers sing the various horn parts.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Vocalize"); ?>
The practice of some musicians to sing along while they <?php DefLink("improvise"); ?>. 
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Waltz"); ?>
A song in 3/4.
</p>

<p>
<?php DefTitle("Who Parked the Car"); ?>
A common rhythm for playing a jazz <?php DefLink("waltz"); ?> is represented by the phrase, "Who parked the 
car?"  The rhythm is "1 and (2) and 3."
