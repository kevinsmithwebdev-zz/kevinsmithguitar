<h2>Kevin&#8217;s Advice to Guitar Students -</h2>
<h3>Getting the most out of your lessons.<h3>
</p>

<p>
I'm often asked &mdash; sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly &mdash; how to get 
the most out of their lessons.  <i>What can I do?  What shouldn't I do?</i>  You are taking 
lessons so you've taken a good first step, but lessons are of course a major investement 
and it makes sense to maximize their effect.  Here is my advice - some of it.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Practice:</h3>
Yes, it sounds obvious, but it's amazing how many people don't do it, or don't do it enough.  
Pratice is more important than natural ability, the quality of your instrument, even how good 
your teacher is (but don't tell anyone I said that.)  Practice everyday, even if it's just 
a little &mdash; ten minutes of very focussed practice on a single goal can be <i>very</i> useful.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Practice correctly:</h3>
Understand that there is a difference between "practicing" and "musical goofing off."  Don't get me 
wrong, there is nothing wrong with "musical goofing off" &mdash; I love sitting around with the guitar, slumped 
on the couch, watching a little TV, eating some pretzels, and jamming on some tunes.  But that is <i>not</i> 
"practicing."  That would be sitting somewhere quiet and working through the materials on which I need to work 
for a fixed period of time.  Make time for both, but don't confuse the two.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Practice every day:</h3>
I can't stress this enough &mdash; practice every day.  There is something about daily practice that 
<i>really</i> reinforces things.  Practicing 30 minutes a every day of the week is much more useful 
than practicing for 2 hours a day on just two days a week.  The constant reinforment, before you have 
a chance to forget it seems to be critical to the learning process.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Don't stop if you make a mistake:</h3>
One of the biggest mistakes that people make is to stop when they make a mistake.  It is human nature 
of course &mdash; we've made a mistake so we have to stop, figure out what went wrong, then fix it.  
That works if you are writing a story, but not in music.  Music is an art that takes place in temporal 
space &mdash; it is a time-based art.  Once a note has been misplayed, it cannot be "fixed" &mdash; it 
is passed and stopping will only ruin the next note and the ones that follow.  The best thing to do is 
to try to keep playing as if you never made the mistake.  This is the important for three reasons: it 
will save the rest of the song, it will keep the song from dying, and if you do it with enough confindence 
the audience may not even notice.  Really, the band will forgive you for playing a wrong note, but if you 
kill the song, they will string you up in the alley.  It is better to play the wrong note at the right time 
than to play the right note at the wrong time.  And if you practice by stopping everytime something goes 
wrong, then that is what you will do on the gig.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Don't practice too fast:</h3>
Up to 60,000 years ago, our cromagnon ancestors began doing "art": paintings, decorive pottery and weaving.  
Music, being a more abstract art form, presumably it developed later.  At one point, one of these early 
men or women became quite adept at the bne flute or hitting a hollow log with a stick and one of the 
younger members of the tribe asked them for a lesson.  After teaching his/her student a few basic skills, 
this prehistoric teacher uttered perhaps the most important piece of advice ever uttered, "Practice it 
slowly then speed it up gradually &mdash; if you're making mistakes, then you're playing it too fast."  
Unfortunately, this first music student ignored the advice and every music student since has done the 
same.  I know, because my teachers have always told me the same venerable advice and I had the 
darndedest time following it.  Now I tell <i>my</i> students the same thing and act surprised when 
they don't follow my advice.
</p><p>
But it is essential.  By practicing to fast, you are practicing playing sloppy and out of controll.  You 
are probably listening to the speed and how you want it to sound instead of how it does sound &mdash; 
this creates a disconnect between what you are playing and what you are hearing.  Plus, you are creating 
an association of anxiety with the music that you are playing.  This is the opposite of what we want.  
We want to be in complete control of the music, executing it flawlessly, hearing what is really happening, 
and doing it from a platform of complete relaxation and calm.  We do this by practicing slowly and 
getting it perfect before speeding it up.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Learn to read music:</h3>
I insist that all students under the age of 16 learn to read music.  Once you're old enough to drive, 
I figure you can make up your own mind, but I still recommend it.  It may not be easy, but it only 
gets harder.
</p><p>
There is a whole world of music out there from which guitarists cut themselves off by not learning the 
universal language of music.  True, we do have tab, which has been around for five centuries, but that 
is a language unique to guitar &mdash; standard notation is the <i>lingua franca</i>.  Additionally, 
there is something about standard notation helps in the understanding of music.  Tab is wonderful at 
showing where something is to be played on the neck, but standard notation shows us what is happening 
<i>musically</i>.  I'm not saying not to learn/use tab &mdash it is useful and ubiquitous.  I'm just 
saying that you should be bilingual.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Get a metronome:</h3>
Other than a guitar, this is the single most useful piece of equipment.  Music is a <i>time</i> based 
art.  <i>Tempo</i> (the Italian word for "time") is crucial.  You <i>must</i> be able to hold your tempo 
steady &mdash; your audience will thank you.  And if you want to ever play with other musicians, it will 
be a nightmare unless you all know exactly where the beat is.  One of the biggest things that makes a band 
sound "tight" is if they all have a strong sense of time.  True, their ability to listen to each other's time 
is part of this equation, but a metronome also teaches this &mdash; it teaches you to listen to an external 
time source and to uncounsiously adjust to it.  A metronome may be too much for beginners, but once you get 
to an intermediate level, it is a must.

<p>
<h3>Become obsessed with your "sound":</h3>
There is more to music than just playing the right notes &mdash; how you play them may be even more important.  
Always be listening to your tone and your phrasing, even if just practicing a scale.  If you do this when you 
practice, then you will do it uncounciously when it is time for the gig.  Believe me, there is enought to worry 
about without having to suddenly think <i>Oh crap!  How do I make these notes sound good?  What did he tell me?</i>  
Just make it part of how you always play music.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Play everything "musically":</h3>
Even the simplest exercise should be played musically.  Like with "tone", if you do it when you practice, you 
will automatically do it on the gig.  When you practice your scales, imagine that you are giving a concert and 
the audience is hanging on every note.  It may sound silly, but try to get inside every note and have it tell 
a story.  If you can learn to make the scale sound musical, then "real" music won't be a problem.
