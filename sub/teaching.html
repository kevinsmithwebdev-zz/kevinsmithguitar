    Kevin has been a teacher almost as long as he has been a guitar player.
    From taking on some blues students at the start of his career to the jazz
    and clasical students of today, he has always been a teacher.  He teachs
    all styles and enjoyed students from 8 to 80. <br/><br/>

    His teaching philosophy is simple - try to mix the "good" in with the "bad."
    Too many teachers dwell on the more boring aspects of music and kill the "joy 
    of playing.  Conversely, many teacher only focus on the simple and fun aspects 
    of playing - creating a shallow and limited understanding.  Kevin
    tries to find a balence between the two.  He tries to spend the first part
    of the lesson working on fundamentals and the second part working on
    something fun - a song the student likes, a particular style, etc.  The
    trick is to link them up and show how they relate to each other.  That's
    where the fun and the learning begin!<br/><br/>
